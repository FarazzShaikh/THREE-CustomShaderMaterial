
- Getter and setters need to be defined via Object.defineProperties and typed via declare
- Multiple CSM instances can be chained.
- Cannot extend ShaderMaterial or RawShaderMaterial directly
- "this" context is set to an instance of the base material in CSM or any class that extends it
- Cache key calculation takes into account base material's cache key. Useful for propagating changes across multiple chained CSM instances.
- use `csm_UnlitFac` to control the mix between lit and unlit materials. Unlit material color defined by `csm_FragColor`
